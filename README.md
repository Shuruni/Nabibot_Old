# Nabibot_Old
This is all of the old code to an IRC Chatbot that I coded back in high school after I had just decided that I was goingto take coding and programming seriously. The code is sloppy as crud and the organization is terrible, as well as the dependencies that I was using being a ton of things that I'm not even sure where to get the libraries anymore. This said, I enjoyed developing Nabibot while livestreaming various games on my twitch and my followers would always help me to work out the kinks in the code and suggest new features. I am currently in the process of rewriting Nabibot now that I have a little bit more time to consider getting back into streaming again.
