#: denotes a comment for extra info #like here #and here... #oh and here
add: obviously it means to skip over it and do better things with your life -3- #refers to command additions
	main: options on a command that are neccesary to include for the command to make sense... or not make sense ^_^;
	opt: options on a command that are optional and because of that will probably never get done >.<
	{}: used to denote an option that is written exactly as it is shown and has sub-options
	<>: used to denote an option that requires actually using your brain to type a specific query
	[]: used to denote an option that is optional. would you like some options with that? #also requires the use of that thing you call a brain :O
	(): if you dont want to be confused, ignore it, it denotes code stuff and hidden options #in depth --> used to denote a hidden option that I need to remember to code for use somewhere else in the options list ^_^;
create: basically refers to things to do in coding... or, ya know.. things to procrastinate...
optimize: refers to things to do that will either make my life easier in the future, or make the program run better
category: a header for grouping several commands that are related but would be strange as indiviual options
cooldown: how often the command can be used
noMod: basically what the command should do if you don't use a modifier
#c#co#com#comm#comme#commen#comment#comments#comments #comments -#comments -3#comments -3-#k I'm done ;)

		4/10) Eto... I hope you aren't mad at me. It's just my opinion of you ^-^;
